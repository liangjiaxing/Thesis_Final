\chapter{Spatial Skyline Subspace}
\label{ch:spatial}

In this chapter, we will introduce the algorithms to compute the spatial skyline subspace queries in range $r$. In the computation of the spatial skyline subspace skyline queries, we use the same set enumeration framework as shown in Chapter~\ref{ch:graph} with different pruning techniques. We introduce a method to prune the unnecessary \emph{dominating candidates} based on the geometric property of spatial skyline subspace.

\section{Label Collecting in Range $r$}
We index the data points in R-tree. In R-tree we can get all the points in a certain rectangle in $O(M \log_M n)$ time~\cite{guttman1984r}. $M$ is the maximum number of entries of each bounding box and $n$ is the total number of points. By indexing the data points in R-tree, if we want access the neighbouring points of certain query point $q$, we can query the square with its center on point $q$ in R-tree without accessing the whole set of data points. We compute the \emph{labeled distance vector} of query point $q$, $LV_q$, by retrieving the labels of the points in rectangle with upper-left corner point $(p.x - r, p.y - r)$ and lower-right corner point $(p.x + r, p.y + r)$ and checking whether those labels are in range $r$ of the query point $q$. Then we collect the distances to those labels as the labeled distance vector of $q$, $LV_q$.

\section{Dominating Candidates in Spatial Subspace Skyline}

In this section, we will show an algorithm to compute the $\mathit{CAND}$ of all $1$-dimensional subspaces. For dominating candidate point $v$ in the data set, we build the labeled distance vector $LV_v$ of the point $v$ by making an $2r \times 2r$ square query centering in point $v$ on R-tree.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
  \caption{Dominating Candidates}
  \label{algo:spatial_cand}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
  \show\LOOP
    \REQUIRE R-tree $R$ that indexes the spatial points and labeled distance vector $LV_q$ of query point $q$;
    \ENSURE Dominating Candidates Set $\mathit{CAND}$ of all $1$-dimensional subspaces, $\mathit{SDS}$ and $\mathit{EQS}$ of all points;
    \FORALL {$\left(l, dist\right)$ in $LV_q$}
        \FORALL {point $p$ contains label $l$}
            \STATE $rec = R.query(p.x-dist, p.y-dist, p.x+dist, p.y+dist)$
            \FORALL {point $u$ in $rec$}
                \STATE $d$ = $distance(v, p)$
                \IF {$d < dist$}
                    \STATE add$(u, dom)$ to $\mathit{CAND}_l$
                    \STATE add$l$ to $\mathit{SDS}_u$
                \ENDIF
                \IF {$d == dist$}
                    \STATE add $(u, eq)$ to $\mathit{CAND}_l$
                    \STATE add $l$ to $\mathit{EQS}_u$
                \ENDIF
            \ENDFOR
            
        \ENDFOR
    \ENDFOR
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Consider the Figure~\ref{fig:spatial_map} and \ref{tab:spot_category} as a running example, and let the radius $r = 2$, we compute the labeled distance vectors of each points by applying Algorithm~\ref{algo:spatial_cand}.

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{llll}
    \hline
    Distances & A & B & C \\ \hline
    $u$       & 0 & $\infty$ & $\infty$ \\ \hline
    $v$       & $\sqrt{2}$ & $\infty$ & $\infty$ \\ \hline
    $w$       & $\infty$ & 0 & 0 \\ \hline
    $x$       & $\infty$ & $\infty$ & $\infty$ \\ \hline
    $y$       & $\infty$ & 0 & 1 \\ \hline
    $z$       & $\sqrt{2}$ & 1 & 2 \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Labeled distance vector of each points}
    \label{tab:lv_spatial}
\end{table}

\section{Same Region Pruning}
After getting the list of dominating candidate sets and the $\mathit{SDS}$ and $\mathit{EQS}$ of all the points, we can prune some unnecessary candidate points of the dominating candidate sets. By Property~\ref{ppt:prune_cand}, we can see that if two points $u$ and $v$ have the same $\mathit{SDS}_u$ and $\mathit{SDS}_v$ and they have the same $\mathit{EQS}_u$ and $\mathit{EQS}_v$, then one of the point $u$ and $v$ can be pruned by the other.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figs/Circle_Spatial_Example}
    \caption{We can pick one candidate from each region (with same color) and eliminate the others.}
    \label{fig:circle_example}
\end{figure}

We will show an example of how the spatial points can be pruned from the dominating candidate set. In Figure~\ref{fig:circle_example}, point $q$ is the query point, point $A$ is a point with label $A$ and point $B$ is a point with label $B$. $r_{A}$ is the distance between query point $q$ and label $A$, and $r_{B}$ is the distance between query point $q$ and label $B$. The blue points ($v_1$ and $v_2$) dominate the query point $q$ in the $1$-dimensional subspace $A$. The green points ($v_5$ and $v_6$) dominate the query point $q$ in subspace $B$. The red points ($v_3$ and $v_4$) dominate the query point $q$ in subspace $(A, B)$. In this example, the points with the same colors, ($v_1$, $v_2$), ($v_3$, $v_4$), ($v_5$, $v_6$) have the same \emph{strictly dominating subspace} $\mathit{SDS}$ and the same \emph{equivalence subspace} $\mathit{EQS}$. Therefore, we can keep one of the points from each color as a representative and prune the others from the \emph{dominating candidate set}. We will show that the number of region is bounded by the square of the number the of vertices with labels.

\begin{property}
\label{ppt:circle_space}
$n$ circle can only divide the $2$-dimensional space into at most $n(n-1)+2$ different regions.
\end{property}

\begin{proof}
Proof by induction.\\
Basic: If $n=1$, then one circle divide the $2$-dimensional space into $2$ different regions.\\
Inductive step: Assume that the statement holds for $k$, i.e., $k$ circles can only divide the space into at most $k(k-1)+2$ different regions. The $(k+1)$th circle can only intersect with at most $k$ circle with $2k$ intersection points. Then the $(k+1)$th can only be divide into $2k$ segments and each segment divide the region it locates into two. Therefore, $k+1$ circles can only divide the space into at most $k(k-1)+2+2k = k(k+1)+2k$ different regions.\\
Since both the basis and the inductive step have been performed, by mathematical induction, the statement holds for all natural number $n$.
\end{proof}

By Property~\ref{ppt:circle_space}, we know that the total number of regions is not greater than the square of total number of vertices containing label. We determine whether two points $u, v$ are in the same region by checking whether $SDS_u$ and $SDS_v$ are the same.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
  \caption{Same Region Pruning}
  \label{algo:spatial_prune}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
  \show\LOOP
    \REQUIRE Dominating Candidates $CAND$, query vertex $q$, graph $G=(V, E)$;
    \ENSURE Pruned Dominating Candidates $CAND$;
    \FORALL {$(l, dist)$ in $LV_q$}
        \FORALL {$u$ in $CAND_l$}
            \IF {$u$ is in the same region as other points}
                \STATE delete $u$ from $CAND_l$
            \ENDIF
        \ENDFOR
    \ENDFOR
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

After applying the Algorithm~\ref{algo:spatial_prune} to prune the unnecessary elements in the \emph{dominating candidate set} in all $1$-dimensional subspace, we will use the same set-enumeration method of skyline subspace computation from Chapter~\ref{ch:graph} to compute the \emph{dominating candidate sets} of all subspaces in order to get the spatial skyline subspace.
