\prefacesection{Abstract}

Skyline computation is important in applications that involve multi-criteria decision making. In this thesis, we consider the following problem: given a query point, find the subspaces where the query point is in the subspace skyline. Although efficient algorithms for subspace skyline computation were developed in many existing studies, finding skyline subspaces for one certain query point is still an open problem. We develop an algorithm based on bottom-up set enumeration to compute the skyline subspace efficiently. We formulate the problem of identify the uniqueness of a given vertex to skyline subspace queries problem on graph and proposed effective pruning methods to tackle this problem. We further conduct experiments on both real world datasets and synthetic datasets to verify the efficiency of our method.
