%Despite the vast researches on database similarity search and similarity join, little work has been embarked on the similarity search problem when the query is evolving.  Such a similarity search query has many applications.  For example, how can we select advertisements for new users who register at a Q\&A website to capture the evolving trend of user interest?  How can we continuously recommend songs by user hamming?  Motivated by the above application scenarios, in this thesis, we study a novel problem of continuous similarity search for evolving queries.  Given a set of objects, each being a set or multi-set of items, and a data stream where each element is from the same lexicon as the objects, we want to continuously maintain the top-$k$ most similar objects usdiing the last $n$ items in the stream as an evolving query.  We show that the problem has a few important applications.  At the same time, the problem is challenging.  We develop a filtering-based method and a MinHash-based method.  Our experimental results on both real data sets and synthetic data sets show that our methods are effective and efficient.
